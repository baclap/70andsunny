# 70 AND Sunny

This repo contains the Next.js marketing website for 70 & Sunny Coffee Co. as well as the Sanity CMS for managing content. Both the website and CMS UI are deployed on Vercel from different domains.

**NOTE:** There is a webhook that was manually configured in the Sanity account settings dashboard that triggers a deployment of the website on Vercel when content is updated in the CMS.
